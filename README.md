# Wine-Datasets-Analysis

•	Performed PCA and clustering methods including hierarchical clustering with Complete Linkage and Single Linkage and K-Means clustering with various clusters on white wine and red wine datasets for exploration and comparison. Implemented an elbow method to estimate the optimal number of clusters.  

•	Compared the results of best subset selection, forward stepwise selection, backward stepwise selection and LASSO for variable selection.  
•	Implemented the models of logistic regression with multiple classes, decision trees, random forest and K-nearest neighbors with the selected variables and compare the predictive results on the testing data sets.   

•	The results showed that the random forest achieved a better prediction of wine quality on white wine dataset at 66.84%, while KNN achieved a better prediction of wine quality on red wine dataset at 69.58%. A wine identifier model was also built before determine which quality prediction method will be used with KNN method with the percentage accuracy of 98.7%.
